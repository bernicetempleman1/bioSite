            <h2>Tell me about yourself.</h2>

            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the first paragraph below to answer tell me about yourself -->
            <p>Thank you for asking. I am a collaborative and solution-driven software developer with over five years of experience working with engineers, developers, and programmers. I have a degree in Computer Science from Youngstown State University and a Master of Science in Computer Information Systems from the Florida Institute of Technology.</p>

            <p>I've already contributed to several projects and assisted with managing a project for one organization.</p>

            <p>Something I've enjoyed and have been able to use in my role as a developer is leveraging my experience in tech support and system administration to help identify and resolve complex issues.</p>

            <p>I worked on several projects using Java, JavaScript, HTML, C++, TypeScript, Visual Basic, MySQL, and Fortran.</p>

            <p>Since my latest role asked for Web Development, I signed up and started an online web development degree to increase my knowledge as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p>My experience has allowed me to sharpen my attention to detail and critical thinking skills and enhance my communication skills working on team-based projects and with clients.</p>

            <p>My latest technical role as a ServiceNow administrator and developer expanded my skills to a cloud platform to deliver client solutions.</p>

            <p>In my role in tech support, I received several commendations from customers where I could identify and resolve their technical issues with clarity and ease.</p>

            <p>I'm excited to collaborate on a team, apply my technical skills to develop applications and systems and contribute to your team in a way that positively impacts the organization and your clients.</p>
